Modern Approach", second edition.

## Informations
The first difficulty, in my opinion, when people first approach a problem
is to find a way to solve it, but the syntax of programming language
also plays a key role.
The aim of this repository is to share solutions to help people in the process
of learning C. Also, to provide a simple idea of some approaches to the problem.
(the "hint" sections of programming projects at the end of each chapter already
provide a good starting point.)

DISCLAIMER: I don't provide the best solution to the problem, in terms of complexity, but 
a possible one.

All testing was done on Linux (WLS) system running GCC 11.4.0. 

To check the gcc version used, enter the following command:
```bash
gcc --version
```
